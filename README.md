# Personal Portfolio

This repository contains the source files for my personal portfolio website. It is a simple static site made up of HTML pages showcasing my background, work experience, projects and contact information.

## Viewing the site locally

Because these are plain HTML files, you can open them directly in your web browser. Clone or download this repository, then open `index.html` or any of the other `.html` files with your browser of choice.

If you want to run a local web server instead, Python comes with a small utility that can serve the files:

```bash
python3 -m http.server
```

After running that command from this directory, navigate to `http://localhost:8000` in your browser to see the site.
